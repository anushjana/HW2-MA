This repository contains Python implementations of two popular multi-armed bandit algorithms: Epsilon Greedy and Thompson Sampling. These algorithms are commonly used for decision-making under uncertainty in fields like online advertising and recommendation systems.

Epsilon Greedy:

Balances exploration and exploitation.
Chooses the best action most of the time and a random action occasionally.

Thompson Sampling:

A probabilistic algorithm.
Chooses actions based on estimated probabilities of being optimal.
Maintains a distribution over expected rewards for each action and samples actions accordingly.
